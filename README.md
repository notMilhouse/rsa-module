# RSA Module

A module for encrypting and decrypting messages using the RSA system

You may call for the methods directly to encrypt or decrypt messages using an existing key or one generated by the module. You may as well generate keys or each constant independently. Also, by executing the script you will be able to use an interactive instance of the module.

## Here is a guide on how to quickly get some stuff done:
_Make sure you have python up and running and that you are on the same folder as the script_

**1. Encrypting a message**

In the python console, do:

```Python
>>> import rsa
>>> encrypt_message(m, public_key)
```

the private key is a pair of elements as: (e, N)

**2. Decrypting a message**

In the python console, do:

```Python
>>> import rsa
>>> decrypt_message(c, private_key)
```

the private key is a pair of elements as: (d, N)

**2. Generating a key given 2 prime numbers**

In the python console, do:

```Python
>>> import rsa
>>> gen_keys(p, q)
```

p and q are the prime numbers you want to use to generate the public and private keys



## Here is an overview of the project's situation

I still don't know how far I want to get this project, but well...

- [X] Reduce the pain of finding the keys manually and make something to actually help me do my Discrete Mathematics homework as well as 

- [ ] Divide in separate files accordingly to function (constant generators, encryption utilities, interactive version)

- [ ] File support

- [ ] String encryption
